# Technical TODOs

- Change the DE selection to be without replacement.
- create a prng object / instance to facilitate reproducibility
- unit tests
- parallel fitness evaluation
- create an Algorithm object, for the DE functions (and alternatives)
- support for objective functions that return multiple values
- support for pre/post evaluation hook
- support for Re-start / Continue optimization
- packaging and usage manual
- visualization scripts

# Research TODOs
